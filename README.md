## the problem
Traditional lecture style delivery is not well suited for online learning.
* Cohort sizes are challenged by current video services and bandwidth
* Keeping everyone on track can be challenging
* Monitoring participation is difficult
* Gauging comprehension is difficult
* Measuring progress is difficult
* Improvement opportuntities can be challenging to spot
