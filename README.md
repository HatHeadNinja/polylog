# Polylog - a bootcamp capstone project
Polylog provides a safe space for remote students to learn and interact during an online live lecture.

## the developers
* [Carl Comtois](https://github.com/TheMartonfi)
* [Doug Dyson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglasdyson/)

## the problem
Traditional lecture style delivery is not well suited for online learning.
* Connecting video cameras and only sharing a screen can leave hesitant students in remote cohorts behind
* Cohort sizes are challenged by current video meeting capabilities
* Monitoring participation is difficult
* Gauging comprehension is difficult
* Measuring engagement is difficult

## the solution
Polylog provides a safe space for remote students to learn and interact during an online live lecture.
